Let's focus on the `ok` function and the logic behind the array lookups, followed by an example trace.

### `ok` Function Explanation

The `ok` function checks if the current assignment of women to men (up to man `c`) is stable. Here's the function again for reference:

```cpp
bool ok(int q[], int c) {
    // Men's preferences
    static int mp[3][3] = {
        {0, 2, 1},  // Man#0's preferences
        {0, 2, 1},  // Man#1's preferences
        {1, 2, 0}   // Man#2's preferences
    };

    // Women's preferences
    static int wp[3][3] = {
        {2, 1, 0},  // Woman#0's preferences
        {0, 1, 2},  // Woman#1's preferences
        {2, 0, 1}   // Woman#2's preferences
    };

    for (int i = 0; i < c; i++) {
        // Check if the same woman is assigned to more than one man
        if (q[i] == q[c]) return false;

        // Check if man #i prefers man #c's wife more than his own wife and if it's reciprocated
        if ((mp[i][q[c]] < mp[i][q[i]]) && (wp[q[c]][i] < wp[q[c]][c])) return false;

        // Check if man #c prefers man #i's wife more than his own wife and if it's reciprocated
        if ((mp[c][q[i]] < mp[c][q[c]]) && (wp[q[i]][c] < wp[q[i]][i])) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Explanation of the Checks

1. **Check if the same woman is assigned to more than one man:**

   ```cpp
   if (q[i] == q[c]) return false;
   ```

   This line checks if the woman assigned to man `c` (current man being evaluated) is the same as the woman assigned to any previous man `i`.

2. **Check if man `i` prefers the current woman of man `c` more than his own and if the current woman of man `c` prefers man `i` more than man `c`:**

   ```cpp
   if ((mp[i][q[c]] < mp[i][q[i]]) && (wp[q[c]][i] < wp[q[c]][c])) return false;
   ```

   - `mp[i][q[c]] < mp[i][q[i]]`: Checks if man `i` prefers the woman assigned to man `c` over his own assigned woman.
   - `wp[q[c]][i] < wp[q[c]][c]`: Checks if the woman assigned to man `c` prefers man `i` over man `c`.

3. **Check if man `c` prefers the woman of man `i` more than his own and if the woman of man `i` prefers man `c` more than man `i`:**

   ```cpp
   if ((mp[c][q[i]] < mp[c][q[c]]) && (wp[q[i]][c] < wp[q[i]][i])) return false;
   ```

   - `mp[c][q[i]] < mp[c][q[c]]`: Checks if man `c` prefers the woman assigned to man `i` over his own assigned woman.
   - `wp[q[i]][c] < wp[q[i]][i]`: Checks if the woman assigned to man `i` prefers man `c` over man `i`.

### Example Trace

Let's trace the function with an example where `q = {0, 1, 2}` and `c = 2`.

1. **Initialization and Function Call**

   ```cpp
   bool result = ok(q, 2); // q = {0, 1, 2}, c = 2
   ```

2. **Loop Through Each Man up to `c` (2 in this case)**

   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < c; i++) {
       // Check if the same woman is assigned to more than one man
       if (q[i] == q[c]) return false;

       // Check if man #i prefers man #c's wife more than his own wife and if it's reciprocated
       if ((mp[i][q[c]] < mp[i][q[i]]) && (wp[q[c]][i] < wp[q[c]][c])) return false;

       // Check if man #c prefers man #i's wife more than his own wife and if it's reciprocated
       if ((mp[c][q[i]] < mp[c][q[c]]) && (wp[q[i]][c] < wp[q[i]][i])) return false;
   }
   ```

3. **Check for Each Man `i`**

   - For `i = 0` (Man#0):
     - `q[0] == q[2]` → `0 == 2` → `false` (no same woman assigned to more than one man)

     - `mp[0][2] < mp[0][0]` → `1 < 0` → `false` (Man#0 does not prefer Woman#2 over Woman#0)

     - `mp[2][0] < mp[2][2]` → `1 < 0` → `false` (Man#2 does not prefer Woman#0 over Woman#2)

   - For `i = 1` (Man#1):
     - `q[1] == q[2]` → `1 == 2` → `false` (no same woman assigned to more than one man)

     - `mp[1][2] < mp[1][1]` → `1 < 2` → `true`
     - `wp[2][1] < wp[2][2]` → `0 < 1` → `true`

     Since both conditions are true, the function returns `false` indicating instability.

In this example, the function identifies that Man#1 prefers Woman#2 over his assigned Woman#1 and Woman#2 prefers Man#1 over her assigned Man#2, leading to instability in this arrangement. Therefore, the `ok` function returns `false`.
